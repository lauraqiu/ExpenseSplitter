# My Personal Project

## Expense Splitter

This application will help users to **calculate their expenses and split it among other people**. Users are able to
input the expense and the people involved and the application will calculate the amount that each person would 
need to contribute.

The expense splitter can be used mainly by **friends and roommates**, who commonly share expenses, such as household
supplies, utilities, or a restaurant bill. It can also be used by groups who are travelling on trips together,
where expenses are commonly shared. 

This project is of interest to me because I commonly find myself in situations where I split an expense with others 
and this application would be a good way to keep track of the shared expenses.
